Dear type designers, 

I’m proud to announce Type Foundries Direct!  A search engine and website builder for independent type foundries and type designers.  Keep 100% of your commission by selling directly to your customers.

I look forward to releasing my project and helping independent type foundries and type designers stay independent and grow their businesses.

If you have ideas or feedback, please [contact me](https://typefoundries.direct/contact).  Otherwise, follow me on GitHub @typefoundriesdirect to stay up to date with my progress.  Thanks for your support!
